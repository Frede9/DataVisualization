### Data Visualization

This repository contains a brief overview of how to visualize your data insights. It gives some hints which method to visualize fits good to your data.
Visualizations take a big part in exploreing and explaning your data. You can look for relationships in the data and ask questions about them. You can highlight insights and surround it with a story.

The so called **Chart Junk** describes all unnecessary things in your visualization. The _data ink ratio_ is the amount of ink used to describe the data divided by the amount of ink used to describe everything else. Therefore we want a high data ink ratio.
